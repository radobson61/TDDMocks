# TDDMocks
from my Knowledge Sharing

This project is a version of the bowling game kata using mocks to replicate a more complex environment.

## Kata

## Test Driven Development
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a technique / practice / method of coding in which you write a test first, then the code. TDD ensures you have sufficient time to test (because you do it first). 

## Mocks
Non-trivial software systems connect with other systems. In order separate the code in one system from another, many people use mocks to mimic the performance of outside systems.

## The System (Architecture)
Because our system is now non-trivial,  we need to spend some time on architecture.

# First Test

## Write the test (red)

## Make it pass (green)

## Make it clean / better (refactor)

# Second Test

## Write the test (red)

## Make it pass (green)

## Make it clean / better (refactor)

# Third Test

## Write the test (red)

## Make it pass (green)

## Make it clean / better (refactor)

# Fourth Test

## Write the test (red)

## Make it pass (green)

## Make it clean / better (refactor)


# Last Test

## Write the test (red)
